# Welcome to OpenAstronomyLog

##Goal##
**OpenAstronomyLog** is a free and open XML schema definition for all kinds of astronomical observations. 
Software that supports this schema enables an observer to share observations with other observers or move observations 
among software products.

##History##
The schema (formerly known as COMAST schema) was primarily developed by the 
german ["Fachgruppe für Computerastronomie"](http://www.vds-astro.de/fachgruppen/computerastronomie.html) (section for computerastronomy) which is a subsection of Germany's largest
astronomy union, [VDS](http://www.vds-astro.de/) (Vereinigung der Sternfreunde e.V.) 
Starting with version 2.0 the schema was renamed from COMAST (abbr. for *Com*puter *Ast*ronomy) to **OpenAstronomyLog**, or **\<OAL\>**.

##License##
The schema is released under the [APACHE Software License 2.0](https://github.com/openastronomylog/openastronomylog/blob/master/LICENSE) and is currently supported in both open source and 
commercial software. Just [download the schema archive](https://github.com/openastronomylog/openastronomylog/blob/master/OAL21.zip?raw=true)!

##Contribution##
In you want to contribute to **\<OAL\>** please join the [OpenAstronomyLog discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openastronomylog).
